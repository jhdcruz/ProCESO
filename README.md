## Project Objectives

This capstone project aims to develop an AI-integrated web-based community outreach management system that simplifies
and centralizes administrative tasks to enhance the efficiency and impact of the institution’s community extension
services in fostering sustainable community relationships.

1. **To develop a system feature that facilitates the planning and coordination of community outreach activities**, such
   as managing faculty delegation, event sorting and filtering, uploading of after-activity report, and student
   participation;
2. **To implement automated processes for generating, distributing, and validating e-certificates** of participants,
   thereby reducing manual workload and improving operational efficiency;
3. **To integrate AI models for analyzing and evaluating feedback**, such as sentiment analysis, alternative textual
   analytics and analytics dashboard to effectively collect feedback and support data-driven decision-making through
   AI-assisted summary and insights.

## Development

### Prerequisites

1. Download and setup [bun](https://bun.sh).

2. Setup instances of the ff.

   - [Supabase](https://database.new)
   - Configs can be acquired from `supabase/` directory.
   - [Trigger.dev](https://cloud.trigger.dev/)
   - [Resend](https://resend.com/login)
   - [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)

3. Install dependencies using `bun install` or `bun i`.

4. After setting up Supabase tables, generate types locally:

   ```sh
   SUPABASE_PROJECT=your-project-id bun gen:t
   ```

### Setup

1. Setup acquired environment variables from services above in `.env` file.

   > [!NOTE]
   > A copy of `.env` file can be found in `.env.sample` file.

2. Configure Supabase Auth for [Google OAuth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google).

3. Configure `trigger.config.ts`:

   ```ts
   export const config: TriggerConfig = {
     project: '', // change to your trigger.dev project api
     // ...
   };
   ```

4. Run the application

   ```sh
   bun dev     # or dev:t to use turbo
   bun dev:em  # to run email previews by react-email
   ```

### Doppler (Optional)

This project used [Doppler](https://doppler.com) ([CLI](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/install-cli))
for secrets management, therefore most scripts are
tailored for such env variables to be available when
running them using:

```sh
doppler run -- bun gen:t
```

Or you can do an alias to shorten it:

```sh
alias dp='doppler run --'

# now you can run scripts using:
dp bun gen:t
# or
dp bun dev
```

You can upload your existing `.env` file using:

```sh
doppler secret upload .env
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **You wouldn't need an `.env` file when using Doppler**.
> _(You can delete it)_
>
> It acquires the necessary secrets from doppler's dashboard
> using the CLI, and can be used across machines without manual transfers.

## Deployment

> [!NOTE]
> This project was deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
>
> Deploying to other providers are not tested, and is up to you.

After deploying the main application,
Don't forget to deploy the `Trigger.dev` triggers:

```sh
bun deploy:tr
# or
bunx trigger.dev@latest deploy
```
